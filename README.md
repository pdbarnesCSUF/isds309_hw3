Only upload the file "**program.cs**" for each exercise to Titanium. That is the file that contains the code you have written. before uploading it to Titanium, rename the file program.cs to FILENAME.txt and then upload the file. (FILENAME is the name that the each exercise has provided for each program)

For example after completing chapter 2 exercise 6 (**InchesToCentimeterActive**), 

*   Copy the file "**program.cs**" to a new location (that way you don't lose the original program.cs file). 
*   Rename the newly copied file "**program.cs**" to "**InchesToCentimeterActive.txt**" 
*   Upload the file "**InchesToCentimeterActive.txt**" to Titanium. 
*   Repeat these steps for the other exercises.

Good luck,,
