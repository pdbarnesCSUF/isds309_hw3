In the game Rock Paper Scissors, two players simultaneously choose
 one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. If both players 
 choose the same option, then the result is a tie. However, if 
 they choose differently, the winner is determined as follows:

Rock beats scissors, because a rock can break a pair of scissors.

Scissors beats paper, because scissors can cut paper.

Paper beats rock, because a piece of paper can cover a rock.

Create a game in which the computer randomly chooses rock, paper,
 or scissors. Let the user enter a character, r, p, or s, each 
 representing one of the three choices. Then, determine the winner.
 Save the application as RockPaperScissors.cs.

Create a lottery game application named Lottery. Generate three 
random numbers, each between 1 and 4. Allow the user to guess three
 numbers. Compare each of the user’s guesses to the three random 
 numbers, and display a message that includes the user’s guess, the
 randomly determined three-digit number, and the amount of money the
 user has won as follows:

Matching Numbers	Award ($)
Any one matching	10
Two matching	100
Three matching, not in order	1000
Three matching in exact order	10,000
No matches	0

Make certain that your application accommodates repeating digits. 
For example, if a user guesses 1, 2, and 3, and the randomly 
generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do not give the user credit 
for three correct guesses—just one.
